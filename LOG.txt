    Researched Python libraries for turbo codes and error correction. Found a library called CommPy
    which has functions for generating Turbo codes for messages. Although the documentation is somewhat
    lacking, it seems like it will be sufficient for demonstrative purposes for our submission. Our
    off-the-grid solution relies on strong forward-error-correction since the ham radio bridges will
    likely have high packet loss and noise. With CommPy and Scapy, we can simulate FEC codes on real
    traffic and encapsulate it in the appropriate layer with Scapy.

November 2, 4:23PM-7:40PM:

    Generated a minimal framework for the turbo encoding/decoding scheme. The 'pip' distribution of
    CommPy has some errors, so I pulled down the development branch of CommPy. For small messages, the
    error correction seems to work well. I will experiment with longer messages in the upcoming days and
    make the functions more generic to accept arbitrary length message streams.
